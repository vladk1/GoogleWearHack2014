## Remote web/phone/wear Presentation Controller
### _example how to control presntation thorugh android app / wear app:_

presentation is made with the help of [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/) and you example is working at:
[http://present-control.herokuapp.com/myppt](http://present-control.herokuapp.com/myppt)

you can run [android app](https://github.com/vladk1/GoogleWearHack2014AndroidApp), which is compatible with wear.
and control it through simple button control on phone app, or swipe on wear device. 

also, wear app should swipe slides vertically with hand movements. but i didnt have a chance to test it much, as I havent bought the watch yet.
