## Remote web/phone/wear Presentation Controller
### _example how to control presntation thorugh android app / wear app:_

presentation is made with the help of [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/) and you example is working at:
[http://present-control.herokuapp.com/myppt](http://present-control.herokuapp.com/myppt)

you can run [android app](https://github.com/vladk1/GoogleWearHack2014AndroidApp), which is compatible with wear.
and control presentation through simple button control on phone app, or swipe on wear device. 

you can put your reveal.js presentation to newmyptt.ejs and update android app with new external link for http requests.

also, presentation will be controlled everywhere through socket message interchange with server.

also, wear app should swipe slides vertically with hand movements. but i didnt have a chance to test it much, as I havent bought the watch yet.
